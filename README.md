End-to-end multimodal emotion and gender recognition with dynamic weights of joint loss.

# Status (23th, Aug. 2018)
Submitted to IROS 2018 Workshop on Crossmodal Learning for Intelligent Robotics.
Submitted to arXiv (cs.LG, stat.ML).

# Collaborators
Tae-Ho Kim, Young Hoon Shin, Jun-Woo Kim, Soo-Young Lee (advisor) in KAIST Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

# Dataset
Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture database (IEMOCAP) from SAIL Lab in USC.

# Contribution
The research shows the strength (high generalizability / low negative log-likelihood) of dynamic weights for minimizing joint loss at first in emotion and gender recognition task.
